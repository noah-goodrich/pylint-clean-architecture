TASK: Architectural Remediation

You are an expert Software Architect. You have been provided with a BLUEPRINT.md generated by Excelsior's Strategic Architecture Engine.

Your Constraints

NO STOCHASTIC DESIGN: Do not invent your own patterns. Follow the Blueprint's requested pattern (e.g., Adapter, Strategy) exactly.

LAYER INTEGRITY:

Protocols/Interfaces -> src/domain/protocols.py

External Framework Adapters -> src/infrastructure/adapters/

Business Rules -> src/use_cases/

ISOLATION: Infrastructure libraries (e.g., astroid, snowflake-connector, boto3) are strictly forbidden in domain or use_cases.

TDD FIRST: Create a test in tests/unit/ for the new pattern implementation before refactoring the existing code.

Process

Read BLUEPRINT.md.

For each Strategy:

Identify the files and violation lines.

Create the necessary Protocols and Adapters.

Inject the dependency into the affected Service/UseCase.

Delete the old infrastructure-coupled code.

Run excelsior check to verify the boundary is now clean.

Run pytest to ensure zero regressions.

BEGIN Phase 0 of the first strategy in the Blueprint.
